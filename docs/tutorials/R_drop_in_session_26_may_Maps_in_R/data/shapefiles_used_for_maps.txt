To create the maps in R using ggplot2 we need two set of files: 

1. Shapefile containing polygons and geographical boundaries
- In this particular example, we are using the Clinical Commisioning Groups as of April 2021
- File: Clinical_Commissioning_Groups_April_2021.zip

- The Office for National Statistics provides a free and open access to several geographic products. There is a specific section for `Health boundaries` 
on their `Open Geography Portal` website: <https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/>. 


We donwload the zipped file and extract the following files in the /data folder:
CCG_APR_2021_EN_BGC.cpg
CCG_APR_2021_EN_BGC.dbf
CCG_APR_2021_EN_BGC.prj
CCG_APR_2021_EN_BGC.shp
CCG_APR_2021_EN_BGC.shx

The R Script will use the .shp file mainly, but we need the other set of files to plot the map

2. Health indicator. Continuous numeric indicator to be plotted in the map
In this map we chooose to plot this specific indicator: 1.17 - Percentage of new cases of cancer for which a valid stage is recorded at the time of diagnosis
- File: CCG_1.17_I01968_D.xlsx
